# Molecular Phylogenomics Figures Using Mega-X

**Introduction** 

Examples of [Molecular Phylogenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenomics) figures created from self-taught usage of [MEGA-X](https://www.megasoftware.net/) software. Figures were created by first creating FASTA files and obtaining all different necessary sequences. Individual FASTA sequences were aligned to produce an alignment file which was then used to compute evolutionary distance between sequences, ultimately leading to phylogenetic tree. 

**Files** 

`Homo Sapien Histone Methyltransferases.pdf`

Visualizes divergence and distance of all different [histone methyltransferases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_methyltransferase) found in the *Homo Sapien*, human, genome. Input for analysis was ðŸ“œ `KMT_protein_sequences.fasta`. 

`Isolated Influenza A Strains.pdf`

Visualizing divergence of all known isolated strands of [Influenza A](https://www.healthline.com/health/influenza-a-symptoms) with branch lengths and detailed information about each strand provided after each leaf node in the tree. Input for analysis was ðŸ“œ `HA_40.fasta`
